# What this is
**I made this discord bot for people who want to learn python but don't know how to start, I would've made this a webstie but I couldn't host the website 24/7.**
--------------------------------
# How it works.
--------------------------------
The bot will ask some questions and depending on your answers, the bot will give you a variety of challenges, what the bot will do, is run your code, and then compare it to the expected results, this of course will not be hardcoded. If you have any issues either make a issue or DM me on Discord, The Untraceable#4852.
--------------------------------
# Where is the invite for the bot?
Right now the bot is still in development, I will publish the code as it's ready, as for now, you have to wait, you can still invite the bot with the [invite](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=853591984559357973&permissions=2147863616&scope=bot%20applications.commands). **Note** bot asks for permissions to use slash commands but won't be added until discord.py 2.0 where SlashCommands are supported, as of now there will not be any slash commands.
--------------------------------
# I want to contribute, how?
Just make a pull request and I'll review it and accept it if I think it'd be a good addition 
--------------------------------
+ **Note** I don't think I will be able to reward you in any way if you help me, so 
do as you wish :)
--------------------------------
# Why is the bot offline all the time?!
The bot is probably offline because there is either a ground breaking issue with the bot or there is something going on with my hosting service, **or** most likely, I forgot to start the bot. ~~Not the last one~~.
--------------------------------
# Final Notes:
There isn't really much to say apart from, I hope you learn something from the bot and understand much more python than you initially did and you actually make use of the bot. Thanks for reading!
